/** TODO LIST **/

- Authentication system
- Tokens
- MYSQL STUFF:
  · Mysql wrapper class
  · Multi queries ( subqueries in the connector ). This will
    work by adding a parameter "subqueries" into the hook file
    that may refer to another connector alias or to add the raw
    queries in there directly ( maybe better cuz I suppose using another Connector
    inside a connector may lead into cross db problems)
